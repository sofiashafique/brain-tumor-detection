# Brain Tumor Detection with U-Net & Grad-CAM

This project uses a U-Net model with Grad-CAM for brain tumor segmentation from MRI images.

## Features
- U-Net based segmentation
- Grad-CAM visualization for explainability
- High accuracy (99.15%) and precision (99.31%)

## Dataset
Used a public Kaggle MRI dataset. [Link to Dataset]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats20-dataset-training-validation)

## Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
