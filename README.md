# brain-tumor-detection
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for brain tumor detection and segmentation using MRI scans. A U-Net architecture is employed for pixel-level tumor segmentation, and Grad-CAM is integrated to visualize the modelâ€™s focus areas, ensuring transparency and interpretability.
